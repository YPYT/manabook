## The problem to try to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
In my home country (Japan), there is a day for resource garbage, and the day is fixed for discarding no longer needed resources (newspapers, cardboard boxes, textbooks, etc.). Whenever I go to the garbage disposal site on the day of the garbage collection, I always see piles of textbooks that are still in usable condition.
Also, at the beginning of a new school year, students are required to purchase certain textbooks, which cost approximately $300 to $500 in total. These costs are not low, and there are many people who cannot afford them. Such people attempt to find specific textbooks online or at used bookstores, but sites such as Amazon and E-bay offer a wide variety of products other than textbooks, and when there is no used bookstore nearby, it takes time to find a specific textbook.

## Why should this problem be solved?
By reusing textbooks that are no longer in use, we can save resources and energy to produce textbooks. When textbooks are discarded as recyclable waste, they are recycled as used paper, etc., but this does not save the resources needed to make new textbooks. It also does not save the cost of education for those who want to buy textbooks.
This application is dedicated to unused textbooks, so people do not have to worry about where to buy and sell their textbooks. 
The application will benefit everyone, including the environment.
