## The problem to try to solve by building this particular marketplace app. Why should this problem be solved?
1. Some people are wasting resources by throwing away their learning materials, such as textbooks that could still be used.
- This problem is not good for the environment and we need to save resources and energy. By reusing textbooks that are no longer in use, we can save the resources and energy used to produce new textbooks. When textbooks are discarded as recyclable waste, they are recycled as used paper, and so on, but this does not save the resources used to make new textbooks. 

2. The cost of learning materials is high, especially at university. 
- At the beginning of a new school year, students must purchase specific textbooks, which cost approximately $300 to $500 in total. These costs are not low, and not everyone can afford to get brand new textbooks. 
This marketplace application helps them offer cheaper prices. 

3. When you are trying to find a specific textbook on a website such as Amazon or e-bay, they have too many categories not involved in educational materials, so it takes time to find a specific book that you want.
- Usually, students must buy textbooks before their school courses begin. Therefore, they cannot waste time looking for textbooks.

This application is just for educational materials and will benefit everyone, including the environment.
